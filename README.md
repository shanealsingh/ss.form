# ss.form

A collection of directives that make working with forms in AngularJS a bit less painful.

Currently only have one directive, but will upload more after a slight refactor.

###numericinput
AngularJS directive that only allows numbers to be entered inside a input field even when input type is text.

*Usage*

    #!html
    <input ss-numericinput type="text" />
